It took me 9/10+ months to share OperatingSystemAndDataCenter_2

To give you an idea of the extensive information shared in OperatingSystemAndDataCenter_2:

	-	Since 2015, I have consistently used the Google Maps Timeline feature to track my daily activities.
	-	Similarly, I have preserved my Safari browser history from April 2023, to the present to monitor all the links I interacted with, whether clicked or not.

Most of the time, I only hover over links. By "hovering over a link," I mean moving the mouse pointer over a link without actually clicking on it.



If you remember in OperatingSystemAndDataCenter(https://github.com/yathvi/OperatingSystemAndDataCenter) we defined a new language that has only 7 words.

In OperatingSystemAndDataCenter_2 we define few words which are important to grasp the information present in Internet.

Modern systems face significant cybersecurity challenges:

Authenticators typically generate a new code every 30 seconds or less to enhance security.
Advanced laptops, desktops, and computers now feature multiple cores, enabling parallel and distributed tasks for better performance.
Hypothetically, access to sufficient processing power in data centers could potentially reduce the time needed to hack a system to 30 minutes or less,
possibly even close to the refresh rate of authenticators.


As outlined in the Internet Protocol Suite(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), there are various networking models:

Three-layer, Four-layer, Five-layer, Seven-layer, and even extended models with eight or nine layers.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex/Layer
Layer 8	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8)
Layer 9	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8)	(Redirected from Layer 9)


Conceptual Idea:
Imagine, as part of OperatingSystemAndDataCenter_2, consolidating everything on the Internet and mapping it onto the 7-layer OSI model.
Such a framework could help visualize and organize vast amounts of data and network interactions more comprehensively.

User vs. Software Engineer Perspective

1.	As a Mobile/Laptop User
	-	Your primary concern is knowing how to install an app or program and use it effectively to meet your needs.

2.	As a Software Engineer

	-	You need a deeper understanding of the end-to-end flow of an app or program.
	-	This includes:
		-	How data/information is processed and passed between components.
		-	The interaction between the operating system and the data center, as outlined in OperatingSystemAndDataCenter.
		-Understanding the underlying architectures, protocols, and systems that ensure efficient functionality, reliability, and scalability.

"Wikipedia has redundant data/information but fewer duplicates."

As highlighted in discussions about Generative AI, nearly all Artificial Intelligence tools are trained extensively on Wikipedia due to its vast and structured knowledge base.

 ========================
||	One-Time Activity	||
 ========================
If you thoroughly explore all the software-related (technical) details on Wikipedia, you may notice:

1.	Much of the content feels redundant, as it often revisits core concepts from different perspectives.
2.	Many online courses (e.g., Udemy, Youtube) appear to present information that overlaps significantly with Wikipedia.
	The essence of these courses (e.g., Udemy, Youtube) can often be understood simply by:
	-	Reading course headlines.
	-	Fast-forwarding through explanations.


Reference: Size of Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For context, as of October 16, 2024, the compressed size of all current Wikipedia articles (excluding media) is approximately 24.05 GB.

This raises a fascinating observation: many online learning platforms (e.g., Udemy, Youtube) essentially repurpose and elaborate on knowledge readily available on Wikipedia.



How do you know you read/grasped all courses in Udemy, Youtube or any other learning platform?

1.	Simple, you can interlink the concepts between all of the Udemy, Youtube courses when you search for a word/words in "All pages with prefix"


	All pages with prefix	--->	Virtual

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex/Virtual

	 -------------------------------
	|	1509 (with duplicates)		|
	|	1284 (without duplicates)	|

Key Insights on Wikipedia and Learning Platforms

	As stated earlier, Wikipedia contains redundant information but fewer duplicates, making it a rich resource for grasping vast amounts of information efficiently.

Why Wikipedia is a Comprehensive Resource:
	
	-	The MediaWiki API is an excellent tool to access and extract most of the information available on the Internet.

Observations and Learnings:
	1.	Access to Multiple Resources
		-	With access to a Udemy Business account, I explored multiple courses in parallel.
	2.	Overlap with Wikipedia
		-	Over time, I realized that most of the course content from platforms like Udemy and YouTube is already available on Wikipedia.
	3.	Interconnected Content
		-	After watching numerous technical videos and interlinking them, I observed:
			-	Almost all software-related videos are interlinked
			-	For example, even if a Udemy or YouTube course spans 5 to 100 hours, the majority of its information can also be found on Wikipedia.
		-	This leads to the conclusion that Udemy and YouTube courses largely repurpose information from Wikipedia.
	4.	Past Reference: OperatingSystemAndDataCenter
		-	In OperatingSystemAndDataCenter, I discussed techniques like using a riffle or iPhone photos zoom in/zoom out to quickly read and grasp information.
	5.	Reading vs. Practicing
		-	I defined the importance of balancing reading and practicing to achieve a strong understanding of technical concepts.
	6.	One-Time Activity
		-	As a one-time effort, reading all technical details from Wikipedia (including pages and MediaWiki content) provides a comprehensive grasp of existing concepts.
			This also equips you to understand new courses or content with ease.
	7.	New Content Evolution
		-	Most new content or courses are built on top of existing knowledge with minor changes or enhancements.
			This makes it easier to quickly read and grasp new material.

Example Implementation:
	Based on these insights, I created the following files in a Search folder:
		-	https.txt
		-	Category.txt
		-	Template.txt
		-	search.txt
	These files demonstrate how to structure and organize information for efficient retrieval and understanding.

 ================

1.	Linux Philosophy: "Everything is a File"

	-	Definition:

		In Linux, virtually all system components (devices, sockets, inter-process communication endpoints, etc.) are treated as files or directories.

		-	Advantages:
			-	Unified Interface: Interact with hardware, software, and processes using common read/write operations.
			-	Simplicity: Developers only need to understand a single abstraction layer.

	-	Example in Linux-based Systems:
		-	File Systems: /dev, /proc, /sys for devices, process details, and kernel information.
		-	Network: Sockets appear as file descriptors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.	Android's Relationship with Linux

	-	Linux as the Core:

		Android inherits Linux's kernel and file system structure, ensuring stability and flexibility.

		-	Android Adaptations:

			-	Tailored file systems and directory structures for mobile needs.

			-	Specialized components like Dalvik or ART for running Android applications.

	-	135 Certified Android Brands:

		Android’s versatility allows brands to adapt it for diverse hardware configurations, while retaining the Linux-based core.
		https://www.android.com/intl/en_in/certified/partners/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.	Docker Images and File System Explosion

	-	Docker Images (e.g., Alpine, Ubuntu):
		Spinning up Docker containers demonstrates how deeply Linux structures its systems into directories and files.

	-	Key Statistics (Tree Files):
	
		-	Alpine tree.txt
			-	1880 directories, 10519 files

		-	Ubuntu tree.txt
			-	5639 directories, 28754 files

	-	Why So Many Files and Directories?

		-	Modularity: Separation of concerns for easier maintenance.

		-	Compatibility: Support for a wide range of tools and libraries.

		-	Extensibility: Accommodates a vast array of use cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.	Insights Gained from Exploring OS Images

	-	Interlinking of Components:

		-	Shared Libraries: Many files are interlinked to minimize redundancy.

		-	Directories with Specific Purposes:

			-	/bin: Essential binaries.
			-	/etc: Configuration files.
			-	/usr: User applications and libraries.

	-	Organizational Simplicity:

		Despite the sheer number of files, logical structuring (e.g., FHS - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) makes navigation straightforward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.	Broader Implications

	-	Understanding Across OS Images:

		Exploring different images helps recognize patterns and design philosophies common to Linux-based systems.

		-	Familiarity with one (e.g., Alpine) makes it easier to understand others (e.g., Ubuntu).

	-	Efficiency of the Linux Ecosystem:

		-	Reusability: Libraries and binaries are shared across distributions

		-	Security: Modular structure aids in pinpointing vulnerabilities.

Concept: Nested Visualization of Processes and Network Mapping

1.	Nodes as Processes

	-	Definition of Nodes:

		Each process and its associated child processes, threads, or fibers is represented as a node in the graph.

			-	Parent-Child Relationships: Visualize the hierarchy of processes and threads.
			-	Node Attributes:
				-	Process ID (PID): Unique identifier for each process.
				-	Type: Main process, thread, or fiber.
				-	Resource Usage: CPU, memory, etc.

2.	Edges as Connections

	-	Definition of Edges:

		Represent inter-process communication (IPC) or network connections between nodes.

			-	Attributes of Edges:
				-	Type:
					-	Local IPC (shared memory, pipes, etc.).
					-	Network (TCP/UDP).
				-	IP and Ports: Display the IP addresses and port numbers used for network communication.
				-	Bandwidth or Latency: If available, include network performance metrics.

3.	Nested Containers and Virtualization

	-	Nested Containers:

		Represent virtualization layers (e.g., Docker inside Docker) as nested subgraphs within the primary graph.

		-	Example:
			-	Outer Layer: Parent container or virtual machine (VM).
			-	Inner Layer: Child container or nested VM.
		
	-	Mapping Nested Processes:
		-	Show the isolation of processes within each container or VM.
		-	Map interconnections within and between containers.

4. Visualization Strategy

	-	Graph Representation:
		Use graph theory for a clear visualization:
		-	Nodes: Represent processes and threads.
		-	Edges: Represent connections with attributes like IP and ports.

	-	Tools for Visualization:
		-	Graph Libraries:
			-	Python's NetworkX or Graphviz for creating and rendering the graph.
			-	JavaScript-based tools like D3.js for interactive web visualization.

		-	Network Analysis Tools:
			-	Tools like Wireshark or TCPDump to capture and analyze network data for edge mapping.

Physical Infrastructure Dependency
	-	Physical routers and switches that power the Internet are inherently dependent on factors such as whether they are connected to an electric current or not.
	This highlights the critical role of uninterrupted power supply in maintaining connectivity and system functionality.

My 13 Years of Software Experience
	I typically describe my 13 years of software experience as follows:
	
	1.	DevOps Expertise
		-	Comprehensive end-to-end DevOps experience on both Windows and Mac operating systems, using laptops and desktops.

	2.	VPN and Collaboration
		-	Regularly connect to client-specific VPNs to collaborate with cross-functional teams, including:
			-	Development teams
			-	Testing teams
			-	Performance testing teams

		-	Coordinated efforts focus on managing a suite of applications efficiently.

	3.	Efficient Development and Deployment
		-	Team members leverage a variety of efficient tools to:
			-	Develop optimized code/applications.
			-	Deploy these applications to production with a focus on:
				-	Minimizing memory consumption.
				-	Ensuring the application runs efficiently using available processors (e.g., CPUs).

Key Insight: Software Knowledge Is Defined and Written

It's important to note that all the information available on the Internet about software is defined and written by someone.

My Experience:

	-	With 13+ years as a software engineer, my day-to-day activities focus on software-related tasks, such as:
		-	Writing and maintaining code.
		-	Collaborating on software development and deployment.

	-	It is not about understanding hardware details like:
		-	Motherboards, processors, or circuit designs.
		-	The materials used in processors.
		-	How electrical signals flow between hardware components.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Languages and Keywords

Every programming language has its own set of keywords that form the foundation for building software applications.

Programming Languages by Keyword Count

Reference:	https://github.com/e3b0c442/keywords/blob/main/chart.png

1.	Why Keyword Count Matters
	-	The number of keywords in a programming language can hint at its simplicity or complexity.
	-	This affects:
		-	The simplicity/complexity of solutions created by developers.
		-	The maintenance cost and ease of hiring for these solutions.
	-	Note: While keyword count is an indicator, other factors like language idioms also play a significant role.

2.	Example: Java Keywords
	-	In Java, there are 68 reserved words with predefined meanings that developers use to write programs.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AI and Keywords

Artificial Intelligence models like ChatGPT are built on a foundation that could be compared to a dictionary of the English language, or perhaps even a vast set of keywords.

	-	Similar to how programming languages rely on keywords, AI relies on its understanding of words and context to generate coherent responses.

	-	This demonstrates how structured knowledge, whether in natural or programming languages, plays a pivotal role in building both software applications and AI systems.

A Reflection on Time and Information Management

As of January 2025, while writing OperatingSystemAndDataCenter_2, I have completed 13+ years of experience in the software industry.

Human Lifespan and Information Overload

	-	Considering an average human lifespan of 100 years:
		-	This equals 100 × 365 = 36,500 days.
	-	The vast size of the Internet, as noted by Internet Archive, means that managing time effectively to consume relevant information is critical.


Deciding What to Click and Read

Each day involves decisions like:

1.	Which URLs/links to click and read to gain in-depth knowledge.
2.	Which links to hover over for a quicker grasp of information without diving deep.

Example:

	-	If I click 100 new links/URLs each day, in one year, I would have clicked:
		-	100 × 365 = 36,500 links/URLs.
	-	This emphasizes the importance of prioritizing valuable resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supporting Resources

To address this, I’ve included:

1.	Category.txt
	-	Contains 1,400+ unique URLs, categorized for quick access and comprehension.

2.	Template.txt
	-	Includes 260+ unique URLs, providing additional structure to explore efficiently.

3.	30+ Comparison of URLs

4.	60+ List of URLs

5.	Wikimedia Commons and Categories
	-	Resources like Wikimedia Commons media and categories listed at the bottom of each page significantly enhance:
		-	Hover-based exploration.
		-	Faster information retrieval.

Alan Turing a long time ago showed that you can compute anything with actually an even more basic set of primitives, not addition, subtraction.
But instead, with a tape, you would actually have six primitives--
move the tape left,
move the tape right,
read the value at the tape,
put a value on the tape,
erase the value from the tape,
	and
no operation.

And so since he showed this what the result of it actually was is down here.
Anything computable in ONE LANGUAGE is computable in any other PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
So if we had some program written in Java, that basically boils down to something super
long but something that is made up of these six primitives.
That means that if we boil down this program to these six primitives, we can build back up the same program
in a completely different language.
And that's really powerful. That's a really cool statement.

Exploring Information Through Template and Category

1.	"Containers under the hood" Udemy course explains overlay file system.
	And overlay file system is one among the
	Template:File systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:File_systems)
	and
	Category:Computer file systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_file_systems)

2.	Magnitude of Information in the Listing:
	-	With 1400+ Categories, 200+ Templates, 30+ Comparisons, and 60+ Lists, there is a vast repository of technical knowledge.
	-	Example: List_of and Comparison_of links contain interconnected data, offering deeper and broader insights.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking and Managing Updates

1.	App Updates as a Parallel:
	-	I have 150+ apps on my iPhone.
	-	Daily, I receive 5–10 updates that include new features or security fixes.

2.	AI and Wikipedia:
	-	Similar to app updates, AI models (like ChatGPT) are trained on Wikipedia, which is a resource of:
		-	Redundant data with minimal duplicates.
		-	Each edit or update to Wikipedia impacts AI models and tools trained on it.

	-	Key Insight:
		-	Track when articles were last edited/updated to understand the reflection of changes in AI tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking Links and Information Grasping

1.	Consolidating Links:
	-	After gathering data, I searched for the term "https" to identify how many links I had:
		-	Clicked.
		-	Documented.

2.	Time Required to Read/Grasp:
	-	Each link requires its own time for reading and understanding.
		-	Some links (e.g., regular pages) may have less data to process.
		-	Others, such as List_of and Comparison_of, are interlinked, offering more comprehensive information but requiring more time to explore.
